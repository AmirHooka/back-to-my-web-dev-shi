## ðŸ’» What it is

This site is:

- ðŸ§¼ **Minimal by design** â€“ because greatness grows in stages
- ðŸš§ **Work in progress** â€“ updated as I level up
- ðŸ“œ **Static and smooth** â€“ no JS frameworks... yet

## ðŸ“‚ What's inside

- `index.html` â€“ my canvas, built from scratch  
- styles.css â€“ one file, one vibe (i don't think so)
- Responsive enough to not throw up on your poorly water-resistant iphone

## ðŸ§  Why I made it

Iâ€™m learning. Iâ€™m building. Iâ€™m documenting. Like a shitty youtuber who starts filming his shitty lifestyle 
and people start relating to it so he becomes Mr fucking Beast.
This portfolio is more than just a siteâ€”it's a timestamp of the grind. (and my impatience, so you might not wanna open commit history in front of your kids)

## ðŸ“ˆ Next moves

- Add animations with JS  
- Flip the design with dark mode  
- Drop real projects in the mix  
- Maybe React, maybe Vue... weâ€™ll see
